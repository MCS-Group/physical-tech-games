### How to Generate Push Power
1. Each pair of players is assigned **two keys**
2. Players must **alternate pressing** their two keys as fast as possible
3. Simply holding or spamming one key will NOT generate power
4. The faster you alternate, the more push force you generate!

## ⚖️ Block Weight Mechanics

Each block requires a different number of **alternating key presses** to move:

| Block Weight | Alternating Presses to Move | Difficulty |
|--------------|----------------------------|------------|
| 100KG | 3 presses | Easy |
| 200KG | 6 presses | Medium |
| 300KG | 10 presses | Hard |

> 💡 **Strategy Tip:** The 300KG block is hardest to move but counts the same as the 100KG block. Consider your team's focus!
