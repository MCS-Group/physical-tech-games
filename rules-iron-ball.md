## 🎵 Rhythm Mechanic

The game features a **Beat Meter** - a white indicator bar that bounces left and right:

### Timing Zones

| Zone | Location | Effect |
|------|----------|--------|
| 🟡 **PERFECT** | Center (Gold Zone) | Maximum speed + Stamina recovery |
| 🟢 **GOOD** | Near center | Medium speed |
| 🔴 **MISS** | Outside zones | No movement + Stamina drain |

### Beat Meter Behavior
- The white bar continuously moves back and forth
- Tap your action key when it's in the **GOLD TARGET ZONE**
- You must be **holding SHIFT** for taps to register
- Rhythm speed increases with heavier weights

---

## 💪 Stamina System

Each player has a **Stamina Bar** that affects their dragging ability:

| Stamina Level | Effect |
|---------------|--------|
| 100% - 60% | Full dragging capability |
| 60% - 30% | Warning state (yellow bar) |
| 30% - 0% | Danger state (red, flashing bar) |
| 0% | Cannot move until stamina recovers |

### Stamina Management
- ✅ **PERFECT** hits restore stamina
- ⚠️ **GOOD** hits maintain stamina
- ❌ **MISS** hits drain stamina significantly
- 😤 Holding SHIFT without tapping slowly drains stamina
- 😌 Releasing SHIFT allows slow stamina recovery

---

## ⚖️ Round Progression

The iron ball gets heavier each round, affecting difficulty:

| Round | Weight | Beat Speed | Stamina Drain | Difficulty |
|-------|--------|------------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | 100 KG | Slow | Low | ⭐ |
| 2 | 150 KG | Medium | Medium | ⭐⭐ |
| 3 | 200 KG | Fast | Medium-High | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| 4 | 250 KG | Faster | High | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| 5 | 300 KG | Fastest | Very High | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Later rounds require more precise timing. Save your most rhythmically skilled players for rounds 4 and 5!
