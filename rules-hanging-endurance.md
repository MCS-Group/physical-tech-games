## 🎯 The Focus Zone

The Focus Zone is your safe area - represented by a dashed circular border:

### Zone Behavior
| Stage | Size | Border Color | Status |
|-------|------|--------------|--------|
| Start | 200px | 🟢 Green | Safe |
| Mid-game | 120px | 🟡 Yellow | Warning |
| Late-game | 80px | 🔴 Red | Danger |
| Minimum | 40px | 🔴 Red (pulsing) | Critical |

### Zone Shrinking
- The zone **constantly shrinks** over time
- Shrink rate is steady and predictable
- The zone never disappears completely (minimum 40px)
- Smaller zone = harder to stay inside

---

## 🎯 The Reticle

Your reticle is the crosshair that you control:

| Reticle State | Meaning |
|---------------|---------|
| ⚪ White circle | Neutral |
| 🟢 Green glow | Inside zone (safe!) |
| 🔴 Red glow | Outside zone (grip draining!) |

---

## 💨 Wind Gusts

Random wind gusts will push your reticle out of position:

### Wind Characteristics
| Property | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Frequency | Every 2-5 seconds (random) |
| Strength | Variable (30-80 pixels) |
| Direction | Random (any direction) |
| Duration | 0.5 seconds |

### Wind Indicators
- Arrow indicators show wind direction (←→↑↓)
- Active arrows glow **gold**
- Screen briefly shakes during gusts
- Hero character visually struggles

### Countering Wind
1. Watch for the screen shake
2. Note which direction arrows light up
3. Quickly move your mouse in the **opposite** direction
4. Re-center your reticle in the zone

---

## 💪 Grip Strength System

Your Grip Meter represents how long you can hold on:

### Grip Meter Behavior
| Reticle Position | Grip Effect |
|------------------|-------------|
| Inside Zone | Grip **recovers** (+5%/sec) |
| Outside Zone | Grip **drains** (-2%/sec) |

### Grip Meter States
| Level | Color | Visual |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 100% - 60% | 🟢 Green | Stable |
| 60% - 30% | 🟡 Yellow | Warning |
| 30% - 0% | 🔴 Red | Flashing danger |
| 0% | 💀 | FALL! |

### What Happens at 0% Grip
1. Your hero falls from the bar
2. Your time is recorded
3. Your arena becomes inactive
4. You wait for the round to end

## 😤 Hero Expressions

Your pixel hero's face reflects your performance:

| Expression | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| 😤 | Doing well, inside zone |
| 😰 | Struggling, outside zone |
| 😱 | Falling! |

## 💡 Strategy Tips

### General Tips
1. **Stay centered** - Start in the middle of the zone, not the edges
2. **Small movements** - Micro-adjustments are better than big swings
3. **Anticipate shrinking** - Move inward as the zone shrinks
4. **Breathe steadily** - Calm hands make precise movements
5. **Watch for patterns** - Wind gusts have a rhythm

### Advanced Techniques
1. **Pre-position** - Slightly favor the center before gusts
2. **Quick recovery** - After a gust, immediately re-center
3. **Grip management** - Brief zone exits are okay if you recover quickly
4. **Zone awareness** - Keep peripheral vision on zone borders

### Mental Game
1. **Stay calm** - Panic leads to overcorrection
2. **Focus on YOUR arena** - Don't get distracted by opponent
3. **Ignore falls** - Your partner falling shouldn't affect you
4. **Endurance mindset** - It's a marathon, not a sprint
