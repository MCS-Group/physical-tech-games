## 🔧 How the System Works

### Automatic Fade In/Out
The audio manager automatically handles:
- **Fade out** background music before voice-overs (1-2 seconds)
- **Fade in** background music after voice-overs (0.5-1 seconds)
- **Crossfading** between different music tracks (2 seconds)

### Fallback System
If an audio file is missing:
- Game intro missing → Background music starts immediately
- Victory announcement missing → Plays procedural fanfare sound
- Championship missing → Plays procedural fanfare + starts celebration music

**This means the tournament works even without all files!**

---

## 📝 Example Recording Script Template

### For Victory Announcements (Copy/Paste for voice actor)

```
Please record these 8 lines with high energy (like a sports announcer):

1. TEAM 1 AND 2 WON!
2. TEAM 3 AND 4 WON!
3. TEAM 5 AND 6 WON!
4. TEAM 7 AND 8 WON!
5. TEAM 9 AND 10 WON!
6. TEAM 11 AND 12 WON!
7. TEAM 13 AND 14 WON!
8. TEAM 15 AND 16 WON!

Then record these 16 lines:
1. TEAM 1 WON!
2. TEAM 2 WON!
... (and so on)

Tone: Excited, clear, loud, masculine voice.
Each line should be 2-3 seconds maximum.
Save each as separate MP3 files.
```

### For Championship Announcements

```
Please record these 16 lines with MAXIMUM excitement and triumph:

1. PHYSICAL : TECH'S CHAMPIONS ARE TEAM 1!!!
2. PHYSICAL : TECH'S CHAMPIONS ARE TEAM 2!!!
... (and so on through team 16)

Tone: EPIC, triumphant, celebratory - this is the CHAMPIONSHIP!
Emphasize "CHAMPIONS" and the team number.
Each line should be 3-4 seconds.
Save each as separate MP3 files.
```

## 🎯 File Naming is CRITICAL

The system expects **exact file names**. Even one wrong character will cause the file not to play.

### ✅ Correct:
- `victory-team-1-2.mp3`
- `championship-team-10.mp3`
- `game-intro-3.mp3`

### ❌ Wrong:
- `victory-team-1&2.mp3` (use hyphen, not &)
- `championship-team-10 .mp3` (space before extension)
- `Game-Intro-3.mp3` (capital letters)
- `game-intro-3.MP3` (wrong case)

**Use exactly the file names listed in this guide!**

---

## 🆘 Testing Your Audio Files

### Test Individual Files

### Test Full Flow
1. Reset tournament: `resetTournament()` in console
2. Start tournament
